# Kubernetes JSON Schemas

While exploring tooling for Kubernetes I had need for schemas to
describe the definition files, and went looking for something that
didn't require either `kubectl` or similar installed or even a working
Kubernetes installation.

It turns out that the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification
contain this information, but not in a particularly usable format for tools
which might just want a raw [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/).

This repository contains a set of schemas for most recent Kubernetes
versions. For each specified Kubernetes versions you should find three
different flavours:

* X.Y.Z - URL referenced based on the specified GitHub repository
* X.Y.Z-standalone - de-referenced schemas, more useful as standalone documents
* X.Y.Z-local - relative references, useful to avoid the network dependency


## Example

Here are the links to the latest `deployment` schemas for Kubernetes 1.6.6:

* [1.6.6/deployment.json](1.6.6/deployment.json)
* [1.6.6-standalone/deployment.json](1.6.6-standalone/deployment.json)
* [1.6.6-local/deployment.json](1.6.6-local/deployment.json)

## Usage

There are lots of use cases for these schemas, they are primarily useful as a
low-level part of other developer workflow tools. But at a most basic level you can
validate a Kubernetes definition.

Here is a very simply example using the Python [jsonschema client](https://github.com/Julian/jsonschema) and an invalid deployment file:

```
$ jsonschema -F "{error.message}" -i hello-nginx.json 1.6.6-standalone/deployment.json
u'template' is a required property
```

## Specific ideas

As noted these schemas have lots of potential uses for development
tools. Here are a few ideas, some of which I've been hacking on:

* Demonstrating using with the more common YAML serialisation
* Testing tools to show your Kubernetes configuration files are valid,
  and against which versions of Kubernetes
* Migration tools to check your config files are still valid against
  master or beta releases
* Integration with code editors, for instance via something like [Schema
  Store](http://schemastore.org/json/)
* Validation of Kubernetes configs generated by higher-level tools, like
  Helm, Ksonnet or Puppet
* Visual tools for crafting Kubernetes configurations
* Tools to show changes between Kubernetes versions


## Prior-art

The discussion around wanting JSON Schemas for Kubernetes types has
cropped up in a few places, but there are some useful comments on [this
issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/14987).
[Joël Harkes](https://github.com/joelharkes) reached a [similar
conclusion](https://github.com/jbeda/kubernetes-detached/tree/master/api/doc)
to the approach I ended up taking.


## Building the schemas yourself

The tooling for generating these schemas will be available shortly. It's
not Kubernetes specific and should work with other OpenAPI specificied
APIs too. This should be useful if you're using a pre-release or otherwise
modified version of Kubernetes, or something like OpenShift which extends the
standard APIs with additional types.
