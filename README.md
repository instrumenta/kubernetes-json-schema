# Kubernetes JSON Schemas

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/garethr/kubernetes-json-schema.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/garethr/kubernetes-json-schema)

While exploring tooling for Kubernetes I had need for schemas to
describe the definition files, and went looking for something that
didn't require either `kubectl` or similar installed or even a working
Kubernetes installation.

It turns out that the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification
contain this information, but not in a particularly usable format for tools
which might just want a raw [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/).

This repository contains a set of schemas for most recent Kubernetes
versions. For each specified Kubernetes versions you should find four
different flavours:

* vX.Y.Z - URL referenced based on the specified GitHub repository
* vX.Y.Z-standalone - de-referenced schemas, more useful as standalone documents
* vX.Y.Z-local - relative references, useful to avoid the network dependency
* vX.Y.Z-strict - prohibits properties not defined in the schema

Note that the Kubernetes API allows additional properties to be submitted,
but `kubectl` acts like the strict flavour above.


## Example

Here are the links to the `deployment` schemas for Kubernetes 1.6.6:

* [v1.6.6/deployment.json](v1.6.6/deployment.json)
* [v1.6.6-standalone/deployment.json](v1.6.6-standalone/deployment.json)
* [v1.6.6-local/deployment.json](v1.6.6-local/deployment.json)
* [v1.6.6-strict/deployment.json](v1.6.6-strict/deployment.json)

## Usage

There are lots of use cases for these schemas, they are primarily useful as a
low-level part of other developer workflow tools. But at a most basic level you can
validate a Kubernetes definition.

Here is a very simply example using the Python [jsonschema client](https://github.com/Julian/jsonschema) and an invalid deployment file:

```
$ jsonschema -F "{error.message}" -i hello-nginx.json 1.6.6-standalone/deployment.json
u'template' is a required property
```

## Specific ideas

As noted these schemas have lots of potential uses for development
tools. Here are a few ideas, some of which I've been hacking on:

* Demonstrating using with the more common YAML serialisation
* Testing tools to show your Kubernetes configuration files are valid,
  and against which versions of Kubernetes
* Migration tools to check your config files are still valid against
  master or beta releases
* Integration with code editors, for instance via something like [Schema
  Store](http://schemastore.org/json/)
* Validation of Kubernetes configs generated by higher-level tools, like
  Helm, Ksonnet or Puppet
* Visual tools for crafting Kubernetes configurations
* Tools to show changes between Kubernetes versions


## Prior-art

The discussion around wanting JSON Schemas for Kubernetes types has
cropped up in a few places, but there are some useful comments on [this
issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/14987).
[Joël Harkes](https://github.com/joelharkes) reached a [similar
conclusion](https://github.com/jbeda/kubernetes-detached/tree/master/api/doc)
to the approach I ended up taking.


## Building the schemas yourself

The tooling for generating these schemas is [openapi2jsonschema](https://github.com/garethr/openapi2jsonschema). 
It's not Kubernetes specific and should work with other OpenAPI specificied
APIs too. This should be useful if you're using a pre-release or otherwise
modified version of Kubernetes, or something like OpenShift which extends the
standard APIs with additional types.
