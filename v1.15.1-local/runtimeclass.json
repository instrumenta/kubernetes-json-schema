RuntimeClasses are (currently) manually defined by a user or cluster provisioner, and referenced in the PodSpec. The Kubelet is responsible for resolving the RuntimeClassName reference before running the pod.  For more details, see https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/runtime-class.md",

The possible values are specific to the node & CRI configuration.  It is assumed that all handlers are available on every node, and handlers of the same name are equivalent on every node. For example, a handler called \"runc\" might specify that the runc OCI runtime (using native Linux containers) will be used to run the containers in a pod. The Handler must conform to the DNS Label (RFC 1123) requirements, and is immutable."
