The returned list of actions may be incomplete depending on the server's authorization mode, and any errors experienced during the evaluation.

It should NOT Be used by external systems to drive authorization decisions as this raises confused deputy, cache lifetime/revocation, and correctness concerns. SubjectAccessReview, and LocalAccessReview are the correct way to defer authorization decisions to the API server.",
