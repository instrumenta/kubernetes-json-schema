IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the\n\t  IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress.\n2. The `:` delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed.\n\t  Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and\n\t  :443 for https.\nBoth these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue.",
